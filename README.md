# Semantics and Accessibility Challenge

## Goal: 
Alter existing webpage HTML & CSS documents to meet accessibility standards.

## How: 
Change element semantics to be more specific and descriptive; structure the elements in a logical and sequential order; add descriptive tags to images and other unnamed elements.

## Why: 
This will showcase knowledge learned from the bootcamp about accessibility standards as well as html and css elements and how they affect the webpage.

## Result: 
The html document is now structured with header, section, aside, and footer elements that identify the specific parts of the page. The images are labeled with alt tags to describe what the image is. Code was spaced out for easier reading. The css document was altered to eliminate redundant elements. Comments were added to explain purpose of elements.
